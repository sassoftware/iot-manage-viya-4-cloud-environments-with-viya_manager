## -Destroy

Syntax:
```
Viya_Manager -destroy -cluster <cluster name> -provider <provider> [ -remove_cfg ] [ -credentials <file name> ] [ -v | --verbose ]
```
Where:
>>>
- **cluster name** is the name of the cluster being created or modified
- **provider** is one among **AZURE**, **AWS**, or **GCP**
- **remove_cfg** deletes the cluster's configuration folder ($HOME/Viya_Manager/Cloud-Providers/\<provider\>/Clusters/\<cluster name\>)
- **credentials** is the cloud provider's credentials file in $HOME/Viya_Manager/Cloud-Providers/\<provider\>/Credentials. Default is <provider>-credentials.
- **-v | --verbose** enables or suppresses the output of the command to the log
>>>
**-Destroy** is used for the removal of all resources associated with the Kubernetes cluster. It can take several minutes to complete depending on the complexity of the environment. Its execution also removes any reference to the cluster from the local KUBECONFIG file of the person running the command, and can optionally delete the cluster's configuration folder ($HOME/Viya_Manager/Cloud-Providers/\<provider\>/Clusters/\<cluster name\>).

**Example:**
```
Viya_Manager -destroy -cluster viya-iot-azure -provider azure -v
```
Below is an excerpt from the output generated by the command:
```
- Removing cluster infrastructure for viya-iot-azure...
...
Destroy complete! Resources: 33 destroyed.

- Task completed.
- Removing cluster from KUBECONFIG file...deleted cluster viya-iot-azure-aks from /myuser/.kube/config
deleted context viya-iot-azure-aks from /myuser/.kube/config
deleted user viya-iot-azure-cluster-admin-sa from /myuser/.kube/config

- Done!
```
