## -Plan

Syntax:
```
Viya_Manager -plan -cluster <cluster name> -provider <AZURE | AWS | GCP | K8S> [ -location <location> ] [ -credentials <file name> ] [ -template <file name> ] [ -inventory <file name> ] [ -vars <file name> ] [ -v | -verbose ]
```
Where:
>>>
 - **cluster name** is the name of the cluster being created or modified
 - **provider** is one among **AZURE**, **AWS**, or **GCP**
 - **location** is a valid region where the cluster is located. Default is ‘eastus’ for Azure, and ‘us-east-1’ for AWS
 - **credentials** is the cloud provider's credentials file in $HOME/Viya_Manager/Cloud-Providers/\<provider\>/Credentials. Default is <provider>-credentials.
 - **template** is a template file in $HOME/Viya_Manager/Cloud-Providers/\<provider\>/Templates containing the list of settings to be applied to the cluster. Default is <provider>.cfg.template.
 - **inventory** for Open Source Kubernetes (K8S), it specifies the template file with the FQDNs/IP addresses of the cluster's nodes. Default is k8s.inventory.template. Ignored for all other providers
 - **vars** for Open Source Kubernetes (K8S), it specifies the template file with VSPHERE-related options. Default is k8s.ansible-vars.template. Ignored for all other providers
 - **-v | --verbose** enables or suppresses the output of the command to the log
>>>
**-Plan** is used to generate a preview of the Cloud resources before creating the Kubernetes cluster. It acts like a dry-run version of the -apply command, generating the Terraform plan for the cluster without executing it.

**Example:**

Viya_Manager -plan -cluster viya-iot-azure -provider azure -v

Below is an excerpt from the output generated by the command:
```
- Displaying cluster infrastructure for viya-iot-azure...
...
Plan: 33 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't
guarantee to take exactly these actions if you run "terraform apply" now.
